My name is **Ashraf Essaoudi**, 
solving problems and find new challenges to deal with, learning new things and self-education are my passion that's why i found myself into coding, since i was young
üè™ therefore i am currently student at [1337](https://1337.ma/en) school, the IT school which gave me oppurtunity to code , learning new things with peer-to-peer learning
the 42 network projects and exercises you see below are done with peer-to-peer learning and self-education, search and so on, thus many basic concepts are learned from them

‚úàÔ∏è i love coding, discover new places, and of course music is something which required in my daily routine
